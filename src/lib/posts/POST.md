Gather round, children. Your dear old friend, Momus, is going to tell you a tale. Back when I emerged from the primoridal ooze, we were still in the awful habit of reading printed books and articles. I recall well the writings of one Dr. Langdon Winner from those days. Considering the tendency of technologies and products to express a political worldview in his essay "Do Artifacts have Politics?", Dr. Winner remarked that:

> Technological change expresses a panoply of human motives, not the least of which is the desire of some to have dominion over others, even though it may require an occasional sacrifice of cost-cutting and some violence to the norm of getting more from less.
>

Winner's meaning here was that sometimes the politcal intent of a widget was worth a hell of a lot more than what you could sell it for. If your aim was to control the productive capacity and imagination of every leaving human it could be worth trillions.

From my window, I can see the proverbial smoldering crater where Anthropic's office once stood. The inferno of early Generative AI burned brightly in the late 2020s until it consumed multiple billions in funding and nearly brought the global financial system to its knees. But if you ask the crooks behind it was this all worth it they'd have to say yes. Not on any balance sheet but in instantiating a world where workers are even more alienated not only from their work but their ideas and creativity. While certain companies have disappeared, the survivors have only grown stronger. Generative AI has reshaped the way so many people work, study and live.

Let us turn now our horrible antennae to an overgrown jungle of poured concrete and twisted steel girders, that horrible paradise to international capital, a city that should thank the Gods every day that Dubai is 50% tackier and more repressive, Singapore.

After suffering the indignity of only winning 85% of seats in Parliament in 2035, the People's Action Party of Singapore has elevated David Neo to Minister of Education. You may recall that Neo has overseen the development of the Cognitive Play Allocation System; like every Singaporean scheme it is commonly known by its acronym CPAS. Sidebar; what's with all the schemes? Do they like sounding sinister? It doesn't matter. CPAS represents a level of control the Great Leader, Lee Kuan Yew could only dream of. You see, the poor dullard students Singapore churns out are so hopelessly addicted to their beloved LLMs that they can't bear to think without them. Stripped of emotional support blanket, they are thrust into the CPAS where they navigate such insurmountable challenges as maintaining eye contact and holding a conversation. No wonder the government is so anxious about the nation's Total Fertility Rate.

And remember children, now as ever:
